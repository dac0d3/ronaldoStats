# ronaldoStats

This project will get data from every game cristiano ronaldo plays in and will save his goals, assists, minutes playes, yellow cards, and red cards.

This information will be saved in mySQL and will be displayed on a GUI window for tkinter. I will use (dataScraping) on python to get the information

There will also be a page that will show how far away he is from reaching 1000 goals.
